    <p>Its been just over 24 hours in manchester and i can honestly say that so far its great. However i haven't actually made it into manchester city center, most of my time so far has been spent in Didsbury. Didsbury is a small ish village type area south east of the city, its quite picturesque and pleasant all round. <p /> The food has been superb, ive eaten twice, last ngiht at the Metropolitan and today at the sanctuary. Both are trendy type pubs but have had decilious food for under a tenner. <p /> Flat hunting isnt so great. Ive seen a couple of places so far an none are suitable. It seems that everywhere around is area is Victorian style houses with large rooms and big windows. As you delve inside you discover weather the place has had any love. So far none that i have seen have had any modifications since the 70's so ill be looking a little further. <p /> Im off to view a couple more so ill be reporting back soon hopefully.</p>
