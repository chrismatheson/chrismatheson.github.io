    <blockquote><div>Thanks to everyone who donated to my Movember.</div><p /><div>Just to let you know it was not easy going, its been a long itchy, stupid looking road but ive raised Â£120 for charity and i think&nbsp;that's&nbsp;proably worth my small sacrifice and your generosity.</div><p /><div>Here's a photo of before / after for you all to laugh at. It&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;really do it justice as there are some wonderfully subtle shades of ginger and all sorts in there.</div><p /><div>Thank you all</div><p /><div>Chris</div><p /><div><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
