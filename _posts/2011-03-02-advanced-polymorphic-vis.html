    <p>Now ive only been developing in labview for about a year now so there is a good chance that what im trying to do is completely possible only i cant find out how to do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What i want is a polymorphic VI which can change the types and number of its inouts based on the other inputs in a similar way to the "format into string" type of VI supplied by labview.</p>
<p><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

</div>
</p>
<p>There are a few possibilities for changing inputs and other cahrictoristics of a VI at runtime, but to do this when placing and wiring seems virtualy impossible. The best thing i can find so far is an extremely complex polymorphic VI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, better get cracking and find a solution i guess. . . . .</p>
