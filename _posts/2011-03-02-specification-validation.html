<p>So right now I'm writing a document (currently at 105 pages) which explains what each step of my test stand program is supposed to do. What limits are going to be used an how those limits are derived.</p>
<p>This is a near enough 100% manual process involving a lot of flicking backwards and forwards between word and teststand and obviously some hand written notes.</p>
<p>There has to be a better way to integrate specification tracking into teststand / labview??</p>

<p>Ive found that if you select and dragg all of the steps in your seqence file to word it will paste all the step names. Not that usefull but if your starting your specification from scratch its a quick way to create headings or lists to make sure everything is covered.</p>
