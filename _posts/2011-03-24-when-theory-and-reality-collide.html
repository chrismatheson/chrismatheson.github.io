    <p>Im sure everyone has hit this wall at some point, when the thoretical equation does not give the exact result in the real world. These last few weeks i have been battling this problem in the form of Coil Inductance's. I have a need for a ver specific and relitively low inductance with my latest pience of work and figuring out the kinks in the real world vs thoretical has been a right problem.</p>

<p>This equation will only hold up if a lot of real world factors are controlled. In addition to the obvious factors given in the equation ( Coil Diameter, Number of turns, Length of winding) the uniformity of pitch (essenialy the length &amp; number of turns) can have a dramatic effect of low inductance coils.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My theory is that variation in the coil winding has an effect of the quality of the flux field and therefore the inductance of the overall coil. When i have more information i shall report further . . . . .</p>
