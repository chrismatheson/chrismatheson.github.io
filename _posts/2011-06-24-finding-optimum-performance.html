<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:x-small;">While developing a set of VI's to control a TMCM110 Stepper motor controller module via labview i can across a rather interesting problem. The stall detection feature available with this module is only activated after the module has reached its target speed, Why is this important i hear you ask (well i don't hear because i'm not spying on you), its important because this limits the usefulness of this function as a "end stop detection method"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:x-small;">Case in point is my current project, a vacuum sealed variable capacitor which makes adding physical end stop switch impossible. I must find the ends by driving the motor one way or the other until it stalls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial;font-size:x-small;">If my variable capacitor is already sitting at an end stop, driving it towards that end stop indefinitely will surely do my capacitor &amp; motor some damage. </span></p>
