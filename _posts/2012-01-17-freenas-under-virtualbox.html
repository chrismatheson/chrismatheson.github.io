    <p>So i have been playing some more with FreeNas 8 under virtual box to make sure it is capable of doing everything i want before i comit to a lot of hardware, time and possible dataloss.</p>
<p>Today was the step of setting up shares and disk pools etc. All very straight forward bar one unknown detail. Dont think your clever by starting with really small disks. i tried 3 1Gb size virtual drives and then 3 2Gb drives both of which had issues when you try and add them to a pool. So i went for 3x 200Gb virtual drives and bobs your fathers brother.</p>

</p>
<p>So i added some data (1Gb iso file) via CIFS share which worked (if slowish).</p>
<p>Next i tried adding a forth disk, this time on a seperate controller (just to make things more difficult)</p>

<p>There are no obvious options for "adding in a disk" but after a 10 seccond google i found <a href="http://forums.freenas.org/archive/index.php/t-967.html" title="this" target="_blank">this</a>&nbsp;helpful post and followed it.&nbsp;<div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<p>All fine and dandy. Next stage will be to get this running on some actualy hardware and buy some big disks.</p>
