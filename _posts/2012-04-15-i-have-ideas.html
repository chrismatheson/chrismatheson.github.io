every now and again i get ideas, as I'm sure every active minded individual does. Mine tend towards technology, engineering and creating things. So i figured i should start writing some of these down. Im not big headed enough to think that all my ideas will be winners (or haven't been thought of and implemented by someone else) but it might be enjoyable reading for someone and it gets these thoughts out of my head. So here it goes . . . .

<strong>Apps for everyone:</strong>

There are a few companies on the web who will let youÂ "build your own app" and then charge you a small fee to stick it into the app store on your behalf. From what i can see these mostly centre around using a website/program to create a web app in javascript which the company then wrap in a UIWebView, build and publish.

Ive nothing against this, great way to help people create apps. However I've been thinking recently about going a step further (or backwards I'm not quite sure), and letting people 'side load' there own js into an app. The app itself would prity much just be a version of Node.js which would server a local html page to a UIWebView as before. The difference being that anyone could load in there own 'app' say from dropbox or using iTunes etc etc.
