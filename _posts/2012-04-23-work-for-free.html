<p>Increasingly ive been wondering about working for free. Its a goal of many a young tech type to work for some kind of small startup or even to run your own startup. But for the most part that only realy works if A) You have an idea good enough to start a company or B) your super awesome at some programing language or another and a startup is willing to part with what little cash they have so you can work on there product.</p><p>I don't have either of these. What i do have is a technical head, some half decent programming experience (although all self taught in AS3 and random bits and bobs of other languages). so increasingly ive been thinking of volunteering, so to speak, for a small company who would like some code written but maybe inst in a huge hurry.</p>
