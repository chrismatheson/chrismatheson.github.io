<p>For a while now ive been messing about with <a href="http://c9.io/" target="_blank">Cloud9</a>, an online IDE primarily aimed at node.js, or ruby developers. First off, <strong>i love it</strong>.</p><p>I cant speak to Node.JS or Ruby development in Cloud9, but for what ive been doing its worked great. So what have i been doing? Well ive been working on a small side project for my dive club 'QuoteBook' This web app is going to allow the members to add in quotes from people in the club and then read them later.</p><p>The specs of the project are rather simple but the execution is where im starting to take advantage of all the amazing SaaS and Open Source resources avaliable to developers these days.</p><p>Rundown as it stands so far (im only about 50% of the way through my project):</p><p>The application will be client side JavaScript/HMTL/CSS based with a good starting point of <a title="bootstarp" href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/" target="_blank">bootstrap</a>, using <a title="parse" href="https://www.parse.com/" target="_blank">parse</a> for all my backend persistent stuff and <a href="http://jquery.com/" target="_blank">jQuery</a>, with thanks to steven for his <a href="https://github.com/srhyne/jQuery-Parse" target="_blank">jQuery-Parse</a> module, to link these together. All of which will obviously be kept in a <a href="https://github.com/chrismatheson/quoteBook-js" target="_blank">GitHub Repo</a> of my own. </p><p>Cloud9 has GitHub integration which meant including jQuery, bootstrap, and the parse module into my project was a matter of a few 'git pull' commands. C9 has made my 'casual development' approach to creating a web app so easy that even when i try out other approaches such as full blown IDE for all the bells and whistles i.e. <a href="http://www.aptana.com/" target="_blank">aptana IDE</a> or lightweight with just <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a> i keep coming back to C9. Always avaliable, just the right amount of bells and more than capable for the small projects im likely to attack in the future, i would recomend this approach to anyone.</p>
