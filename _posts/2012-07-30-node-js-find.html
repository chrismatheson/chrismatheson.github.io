I found out about a small Node.js server / client framework call <a href="http://meteor.com/" target="_blank">Meteor</a> at the weekend. After watching the video and reading a bit of the front page i was hooked and spent the rest of the day trailing round the shops with Emma reading the API docs.

First of, <strong>this looks awesome</strong> if it works half as well as displayed in the video then im sold. I can integrate bootstrap and backbone into my client side and write small webapp projects in no time. exactly what you need for <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/read/303952445" target="_blank">minimum viable product</a> type projects.

I have some reservations as the whole project runs on top of fibers which has been getting some stick. But maybe the sacrifice of Node.js's great non-blocking architecture for ultimate simplicity in building is something i could get behind.

Anyway keep an eye out here as im sure ill be trying to get a small web-app up and running with the framework very soon.
