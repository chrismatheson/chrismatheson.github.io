So i read <a href="http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/">this</a> article the other day and i don't mind saying that i had no idea how much the "web" hated php. This isn't another post with a new flavour of php bashing but instead i was thinking if there isnt a modern day equivalent of the LAMP server? a popular open-source stack that could be used by one and all from the fledgling developer just starting to play with HTML and progressing to some server side interactions, to the massive multinational serving thousands of requests per hour.

Its seems that LAMP is so popular because it give us everything we need to make a successful website, Apache to deal with requests and serve content, php to programaticly alter / tailor the content, MySQL for persistence, and linux to run all of this. There are obviously hundreds if not thousands of alternative web technologies that can do a better job of one or two parts of this stack but is there really a better overall solution?

My personal love of Node.JS is growing by the day. Given that javascript is probably one of the first experiences of coding that many people get (i dont count HTML as there is no if .. then or other such programming structures) and that more and more we are trying to get people to <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">learn to code</a> shouldn't it be a natural thing for peoples first experience of server side code be in the same language?

So heres my new stack LNEM, Linux, Node.JS, Express, MongoDB. From this starting point anyone can have a website with all that a LAMP could offer but all code is JS and things are all a LOT simpler. <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com" target="_blank">CloudFoundry</a>, <a href="http://heroku.com" target="_blank">Heroku</a>, <a href="http://AppFog.com" target="_blank">AppFog</a> all offer this set-up but no one has made it 'easy for the masses' as it were. To get an app up and running you need to know about Git (heroku) or Manifests (Heroku and CF and AF) its not as simple as FTP upload to LAMP web space.

Shouldnt we make it that simple?
