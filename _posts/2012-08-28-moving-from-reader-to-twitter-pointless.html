Just a quick update to something I mentioned last week, I tried moving from google reader to a twitter list. I can't even last a week and I've gone back. 

Twitter is a great tool and rss feeds may be an old fashioned tech, but for me it works best. I think mostly it's just the user interface rather than the underlying technology.

Anyway for now, reader is my choice
