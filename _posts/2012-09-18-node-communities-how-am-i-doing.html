I've found over my few years of 'learning by doing' that one of the hardest things to get is feedback. If an application works, some would say that that's enough, but for whatever reason i would love to get some feedback from other developers, so I'm putting this post out there and willing to listen and discuss anything that may come up.

My quote book project has gone though a recent change on the 'Dev' Branch of this <a href="https://github.com/chrismatheson/quoteBook/tree/dev" target="_blank">Git hub repo</a>. if anyone would like to take the time to have a read (its not that complex) and give me some feedback either in comments or emails, that would be awesome. My current development can also be seen in <a href="https://c9.io/chrismatheson/quotebook" target="_blank">cloud9 IDE</a>
