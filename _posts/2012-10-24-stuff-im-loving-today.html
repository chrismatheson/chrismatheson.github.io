More and more im falling in love with my raspberryPi not so much for its ultra small form factor computing power, but because its forcing me to learn more Linux bits and bobs and i love that.

today : Screen

Ever wanted to log into an ssh shell and have things exactly where you left them? 'screen -R '
be able to have multiple windows open in your session 'ctl+a, ctl+c' and see a list 'ctl+a, ctl+" '
be able to see tow things at the same time 'ctl+a, ctl+s'

coming late into the command line ninja game this is all probably old to most people, for me its like a whole new lease of life on computing in the command line.
