Client side choices are some of the hardest for any prospective Web Application, there are a myriad of browsers, versions of browsers, networking infrastructures etc etc that can affect your client and therefor your end user experience. Javascript engines are all slightly different from Firefox to Chrome to Opera and arguably worst Internet explorer, so how can I as a developer cope with all these differences? Especially i wont be able to commit even 20% of my time to this project  (its on top of a normal 9-5 remember).
<h2> S<b>tandardization</b></h2>
the only way to deal with this problem is to use some tool which will iron out all of these idiosyncrasies with each browser and give me a level playing field. There are a few Javascript libraries written for this purpose but the winner in this for a long time has been flash. Flash is actually its own run-time environment but is very well supported by all the major browsers and for my purposes will level the playing field perfectly. This does throw some spanners in the works for later on, especially with mobile development.
<h2>Framework</h2>
Before being opensourced Adobe was push Flex as a flexable framework which would compile down to AS3 and run inside the flash run time environment. So without too much thought and investigation this is what i started to develop in and so far all my experiences have been great. Nine times out of Ten when i start to tackle a problem which is complex and not breaking into smaller sections very well i find that with a bit of reading the functionality is already implemented or partially implemented but under a different 'name'.
