following on from my earlier post on how small files can mean big traffic when things <a title="The dreaded scaling word" href="http://chrismatheson.wordpress.com/2012/11/13/the-dreaded-scaling-word/" target="_blank">scale</a> i thought i would explain some of the decision behind UOS online's recording functions. As part of the reading lesson students record their answers so that they can be played back what they said next to a recording of the 'correct' answer but also these answers are stored so the teacher can listen to them also.

So for my part i would have to find a suitable method of accepting these uploaded recordings, storing them and serving them back to the client application at the appropriate time.  The thing about our application stack  is that we are planning to use a PaaS proveder to avoid having to set up

Recordings, DB or files
