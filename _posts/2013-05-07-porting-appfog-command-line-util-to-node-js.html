Recently i tried to explain to a fellow developer how to update our server hosted by <a title="AppFog" href="http://appfog.com" target="_blank">AppFog</a> PaaS, everything in our process is development so its not all that great (yet) and hopefully i will eventually have time to improve &amp; automate this, but for now here it is.
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height:13px;">Built the <a title="Client – Developing Units of Sound online" href="http://chrismatheson.wordpress.com/2013/02/12/client-developing-units-of-sound-online/" target="_blank">Client side app</a> in flash builder</span></li>
	<li>Checkout the latest stable <a title="Developing Units of Sound online" href="http://chrismatheson.wordpress.com/2012/11/16/developing-units-of-sound-online/" target="_blank">Node.JS </a>server app code</li>
	<li>Copy the bin-output dir of client code inside the server's dir structure</li>
	<li>Use the AppFog CLI to update the 'dev' version</li>
	<li>conform this is working ok for a couple of weeks</li>
	<li>clone to 'production'</li>
</ul>
As i said, possibly not the neatest solution, but its what we are currently doing.

Since i develop the server using the wonderful <a href="http://c9.io" target="_blank">Cloud9</a> the awkward part of the process is uploading the bin-output to c9's workspace so i can update using the <strong>af</strong> util. This new dev will be deploying from an OSX machine which we shall say is 'fresh' no OSX homebrew etc, and for now thats the way i want to keep it. Seeing as a fresh OSX Lion machine does not have a version of ruby high enough for AppFog CLI to run, the port to Node.js was born (yes i know they will need to install this too but whatever)

So <a href="https://github.com/chrismatheson/appfog-cli" target="_blank">AppFog CLI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/chrismatheson/appfog-api" target="_blank">AppFog API</a> were both born and so far have about 24 hrs work between them. I've separated this mini project into two parts as hopefully the <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/appfog-api" target="_blank">appfog-api</a> (npm link) will allow others to build automated deployment/monitoring etc into their own apps.

So please <b>npm install af</b> and let me know how you get on with it. Currently this lib is at a very early stage with just the 'get' functions but hopefully by V1.0 i should have implemented the bare minimum of <strong>af update</strong>,<strong> af push</strong>, and<strong> af stat</strong>
