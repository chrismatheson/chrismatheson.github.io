UOS online like any Rich Internet Application (RIA) will need a dedicated server, although i have thought about trying to go without (post for another day), for which there are many different directions i can go in. I have come down to the decision that standard manged hosting will not work for us as we will want, or possibly even need, different technologies on our server than most web hosts are willing to provide. Therefore my choices have come to basically Virtual Machines (VM's) or Platform as a Service (PaaS).

Since our technology selection is Node.JS server installation and configuration should not bee too hard, Node is a single application that require little or no configuration, unlike Apache or Nginx, we would just need to make sure that our application was started on system start up using either system daemons or possibly some other method.
<h2>Best of both worlds.</h2>
By choosing AppFog as our PaaS we have still left the door open for VM based solution. AppFog is based on <a href="http://cloudfoundry.org/" target="_blank">cloud foundry</a>, an open source PaaS which will allow you to download a VM giving you your own Polyglot application server that you can then run on any VM host provider.
