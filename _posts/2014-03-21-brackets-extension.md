Today i released the [brackets-package-viewer](https://github.com/chrismatheson/brackets-package-viewer) an extension for the brilliant [brackets](http://brackets.io) application.

1.0.1 the first real incarnation is a modist extension which searches your current project for all package.json files and show a small over view list with keyword, dependencies & versions in a popup panel.

![image](http://here please :))

i would like to work toward this extension being the goto button for documentation about your current project. Althought this may be at odds with *quick docs* that has never really worked for me personally.
