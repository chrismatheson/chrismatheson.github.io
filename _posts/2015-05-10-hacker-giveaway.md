I recently found a box of stuff that i had great intentions of hacking on at somepoint, but like a lot of things, never got reound to.

So i figured that maybe someone else has more time / persiverance thanI and might be able to do something cool with these things.

So i hearby offer the foloowing bits of hardwares up to the first person to get in touch and ask for them, or (maybe more likely) to the bin in a week or so.
